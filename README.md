# Event-Listners

An Ethereum event listener that bridges your smart contract events and backend microservices. Eventeum listens for specified event emissions from the Ethereum network, and broadcasts these events into your middleware layer. This provides a distinct separation of concerns and means that your microservices do not have to subscribe to events directly to an Ethereum node.


# Features

-> Dynamically Configurable - Eventeum exposes a REST api so that smart contract events can be dynamically subscribed / unsubscribed.

-> Highly Available - Eventeum instances communicate with each other to ensure that every instance is subscribed to the same collection of smart contract events.

-> Resilient - Node failures are detected and event subscriptions will continue from the failure block once the node comes back online.

-> Fork Tolerance - Eventeum can be configured to wait a certain amount of blocks before an event is considered 'Confirmed'. If a fork occurs during this time, a message is broadcast to the network, allowing your services to react to the forked/removed event.
